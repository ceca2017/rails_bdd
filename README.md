## Commenting on articles ##

This is a simple web application that will allow you to view a list of
published articles on the home page.

Clicking on the title of an article will take you to the article's page.

There you are able to add a comment to an article by filling out a form
underneath the article.

The comment field is mandatory to fill out and there is an optional e-mail
address field, if you like to add it to you comment. If you add it, it will
be listed under you comment and also have a mail to link so others can easily
contact you. The field will check and see if you provide and @ symbol and
text before and after (to decrease risk of typos)

You will also be able to see any previoulsy posted comments to this article.
